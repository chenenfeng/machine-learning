there are two datasets, one called train.csv(have the target value), another called test.csv(no target value)
So the following process will call train.csv dataset as train set, test.csv dataset as test set.
Don't confuse them with train_test_split()'s result
1. read_csv files,  index_col = 'Id'!!!!
2. import sklearn library
3. gain target and predictors(features) from train set(what if train and test set have different features?)
4. add a new column ['training test'], value = 1 means train set, value = 0 means test set


5. Predictors = pd.concat[train set, test set]
6. imputer() to handle the missing value in numeric columns
However, find the pd.getdummies can directly do the one-hot encoding, regardless of missing value in categorical data
7. pd.getdummies() to do the one-hot encoding to object columns
8. train_test_spilt
9. XGBoost() to fit(X_train, y_train)
10. XGBoost().predict(X_test)
11. look at the metrics to evaluate this model

in Step 9, I tried RandomFroestRegressor() and XGBoost() and XGBoost(parameters has been tuned)
the best model among these three is: XGBoost(parameters has been tuned)
to explore the algorithms behind them. That is important!
