feature engineering!    tune!     model stack!


AI: to make an agend perceive the world, forms plans and make decision on their own to achieve the goal
ML: subfield of AI 
NLP: need database and knowledge engineering, mathematical logic, language meaning website
      language, format language
real system design, ml platform applement, ex. FBlearner, uber's Micrakilo, know process and pipleline
more detail: BP in NN, engineerize and 
detailed development, be deeper in one area. know everything a little= don't do well in anything
about framework, like caffe tensorflow pytorch mxnet, at least master one of them
towards every model in the specific framework, input? output? arguments?
ml theory

proj: actual work, completion degree, contribution
hashmap, python dictionary  hash() make key and value --> directory, map function: hash funtion
store list： hash table  open addressing

SVM vs Logistic Regression
solution to overfitting、regulation,
droupout,  batch normalisation
framework contribution
convolution
sequence to sequence
make project development: pre-train model able to tailor, check point
depthwise-CNN   1*1 kernel
