know yourself, know data, comprehensive but not exhaustive
problems come, how to form a data analysis princinple??
1. look at each variable, do some analysis and thinking, conceive their meanings and importance to the whole problem
2. focus on dependent variable, do more detailed analysis.
3. fix eyes on relationship between independent variables and dependent variable
4. data clean, such as missing value and categorical data
5. check assumptions, if data don't satisfy the assumptions, how can we apply the model based on some specific assumptions?
