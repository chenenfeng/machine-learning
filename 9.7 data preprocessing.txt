1. import pandas and numpy
2. read_csv()  separate matrix and vectors of independent and dependent variables(first split)
# dataset.iloc[[m],n] express n+1th columns m+1th elements, or can use dataset.iloc([0:2,n])
3. handleing missing data   dropna,   imputer()
4. encoding categorical data, using LabelEncoder class from sklearn.preprocessing.
   but I used to encode categorical variables by importing pandas and use pd.get_dummies
   difference?
5. split the dataset into training set and test set
6. feature scaling because different features highly varing in magnitudes, high will weigh more in the distance calculation
