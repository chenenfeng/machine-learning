solve: both regression and classification
find hyperplane to classify different classes
output: optimal hyperplane, maximize distance to nearest element of each tag
nonlinear: add third dimention
tuning parameter: kernel to transform linear SVM to a linear algebra
                  low gamma(high gamma): points which far away(close to) from seperate line are considered into line calculation
                  regularization: large valur of regularization means model will choose small-margin hyperplane
                  margin: is the seperate line to the closest points of each class, good margin means large distance(am i right)
