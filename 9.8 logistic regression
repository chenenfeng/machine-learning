solve: classification problem
estimation: estimate probabilities using logistic function
logistic function: map: all real number ---> [0,1]  y=1/(1+exp(-x))
after gaining probabilities, they must be transformed to binary values: 0, 1  it will use threshold classifier
output: discrete outcomes

1.data preprocessing
(1) import data
(2) handle missing value
(3) split data to training set and test set
(4) scaling features

2. logistic regression
LogisticRegression().fit(train_X, train_Y)

3. make prediction

4. evaluation the prediction

the story behind logistic regression!!!!!!!!
