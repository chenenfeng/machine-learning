y = b0+b1x1+...+bnxn
assumptions:!!!
1.linearity 
2. Homoscedasticity: constant variance of the error
3. Multivariative Normality: assumes that the residuals are normally distributed
4. Lack of Multicollinearity
select variables:
1. forward selection  2. backward elimination, i love that word  3.bi-directional comparison

dummy variable traps!
if all variables get into a category, there is duplicate, we can just use all n-1 category to describe the left one

step: also the similar three steps:
1. preprocess data
2. fit model to the training set （same model with simple linear regression）
3. make prediction by fitted model
